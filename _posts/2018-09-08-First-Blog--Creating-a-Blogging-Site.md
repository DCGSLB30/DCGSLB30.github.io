    <td>Questioning?</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>For most of the time, I didn’t need to rely on other people to help me if I was stuck, as I could usually get the answer myself.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I looked over what I could do to make my blogging website much more professional.</td>

    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have done more on my table. I need to improve it so that it’s partly transparent. Also, I think that there are lots of things on the ww3 schools website that I need to check to improve my github website. Also, I should listen more attentively to details when our teacher is explaining something.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will look through more of the links to resources that can be found on the Challoners website, as there are still lots of things on the ww3 schools website and others which I will need to improve my blogging website, as it is still far from perfect. To make my blogging site better, I need to find out how to change opacity. Also, I will change the font and much more.</td>
