    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I didn't do things correctly the first time, as I have not used the coding aspects of Google Sheets before. I am not very familiar with them.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>When I couldn’t understand what I was doing wrong, I asked for help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>For most of the time, I didn’t need to rely on other people to help me if I was stuck, as I could usually get the answer myself.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I didn’t do this much this week.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>This week, I didn’t really engage with anyone other than when I asked questions.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I could have written down something if I thought I would forget it, so that I wouldn’t need to ask someone later. In addition to this, I could have tried to memorise the code that our computer science teacher, Mr Keen was telling us. In the lesson, we learnt how to change letters and words to something else, using Google Sheets essentially as a complex calculator with many added features. We changed the letters so they were shifted downwards by one, and gave prices to sandwiches by giving them values and using strings.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try to look over everything that I have learnt in my computer science lesson, and attempt to memorise things that I will need in later lessons, and in coding in general. Also, I need to improve my blogging site on github, as I didn’t change it much since last week. When I try to use rgb colour values to make my container transparent, I am doing something wrong. I will find out what this is.</td>
