    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>This week, I didn’t really engage with anyone other than when I asked questions.</td>

    <td>Firstly, it would have been good if I or someone I was working with had got the answer to how to do the task. We weren’t allowed to look up how to do this either. The entire lesson was spent trying to find out how to decode what we encrypted last week. However, the lesson wasn’t wasted, as I was still able to find out what didn’t work and I exhausted all my ideas of what to do. I assumed that we were still going to use vlookup to decode things.</td>

    <td>Next time, I could write down what I have done so that I can make a list and eliminate possibilities. Other than this however, I cannot think of anything else that I could have done in the lesson. Mr Keen, our IT teacher would not tell us, as that would defeat the purpose of the exercise.</td>
