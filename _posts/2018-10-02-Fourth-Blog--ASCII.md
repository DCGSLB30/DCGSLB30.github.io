    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I didn't need to persevere much this week, as I found changing decimal to binary, hex and characters quite easy.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked the people around me how to change numbers into characters. </td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I did the majority of the work on my own.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>This week, I didn’t really engage with anyone other than when I asked questions.</td>

    <td>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding system. ASCII codes represent text in computers. I think that my learning could have been improved if I had copied and pasted the entire table over into sheets. This would have been better, but I instead used lines of code, e.g. DEC2HEX to convert decimal to, in this case, hexadecimal. However, I could not work out how to convert numbers to characters. I copied and pasted those in. </td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I could copy more of the table into Google Sheets, although I don’t need to. I also could have copied the table from the beginning, but this would mean that I wouldn’t have been able to test if the coding worked. Other than what I have listed above, I don’t think there was anything else that I could have done.</td>
